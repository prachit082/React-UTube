# React UTube - A YouTube Clone

---

UTube is a YouTube clone developed by Prachit and hosted on Vercel. One of the standout features of UTube is its effective utilization of MaterialUI, which provides a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to navigate. Additionally, the clone was built using ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for greater flexibility and customization. Overall, UTube is a great example of a well-designed and functional video sharing platform that has taken advantage of the latest web development technologies.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
